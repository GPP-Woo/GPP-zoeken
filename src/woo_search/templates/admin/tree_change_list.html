    This file is made to alter the tree_change_list.html page within the treebeard library.
    This template only gets used currently in conjuction with the Theme's models.
    Which should only display the loaded in data from the government, so we want to restrict the user from alter the data.
    Hence why I altered this file to remove the js files, which handles requests from the drag and drop feature.
