WOO Search
==========

The Dutch government wishes to be open and transparent to its citizens. To achieve this,
the law "Wet open overheid (WOO)" was established, requiring government organisations to
actively and digitally publish their documents.

WOO Search makes it possible to index these documents in a search engine so they can be
searched with full-text search capabilities from the Citizen Portal.

This component is designed in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.

This project is and only uses :ref:`introduction_open-source`.
