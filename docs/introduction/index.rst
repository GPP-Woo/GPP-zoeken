Introduction
============

The Dutch government wishes to be open and transparent to its citizens. To achieve this,
the law "Wet open overheid (WOO)" was established, requiring government organisations to
actively and digitally publish their documents.

WOO Search makes it possible to index these documents in a search engine so they can be
searched with full-text search capabilities from the Citizen Portal.

For a full publication platform, additional components are required:

* WOO Registraction Component, a component responsible for registering the publication.
* WOO Publications, a dedicated interface for creating, drafting and managing
  publications and related documents.
* WOO Citizen Portal, a component allowing citizens to browse and search through
  publications.

The team behind WOO Publication provides
`implementations <https://github.com/GeneriekPublicatiePlatformWoo>`_ for each of those
components.
